## Aim of the project

Kerhohuone web app using the latest version of Django web programming and Sqlite3 as database. The end result aims to be user-friendly, responsive and have WCAG 2.1 compliant contrast in both light and dark mode (including link and button and UI element colors should have high enough contrast).

## Programming practices
Use best programming practices. Include comprehensive error checking by default. Use constants instead of magic values. Keep the code short and elegant. Use class-based generic views when applicable.

Make sure all the templates inherit from base template, which is responsive and supports both light and dark mode.

## Test code

Include comprehensive test code, which checks the following:
- Chinese and Arabic text for input and output strings
- very large and very small positive and negative numbers for numbers
- decimal numbers for floating point numbers
- database access, file loading and saving might fail for multiple reasons (incorrect path and file name, lack of privilege, corrupted content, out of disk space, internet connection errors)

## Documentation
Update Readme.md automatically to explain the main features of the program, including some examples.
update TODO.md to keep up a list of features still to implement or fix.
